# dual-lib-main-crate

A boilerplate/pattern reminder for how to set up a dual crate with both a main
and a lib build component (e.g. where you might want to reimport a bunch of
functions as a crate, but don't want to set up a separate crate for your cli
wrapper).

Mostly for my own use. No claims made for suitability or anything else.
